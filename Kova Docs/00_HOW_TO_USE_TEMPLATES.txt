4. TEMPLATE_SPE_Scattered_Lot.csv - Buy individual lots, build, sell
5. TEMPLATE_SPE_Lot_Purchase.csv - Buy bulk lots from developer, build, sell

================================================================================
STEP-BY-STEP: HOW TO USE THESE TEMPLATES
================================================================================

🎯 STEP 1: SELECT THE RIGHT TEMPLATE
------------------------------------

DECISION TREE:

Q1: Is this your main homebuilding company?
    ├─ YES → Use: TEMPLATE_Operating_Company.csv
    │         (Example: Red Cedar Homes, LLC)
    └─ NO → Go to Q2

Q2: Is this a single-purpose project entity (SPE)?
    └─ YES → Go to Q3

Q3: What does this entity do?
    
    ├─ Buy RAW land → Entitle → Develop infrastructure → Sell LOTS
    │  (You're NOT building homes, just creating finished lots)
    │  → Use: TEMPLATE_SPE_Lot_Development.csv
    │     Example: 1943 Pelham, LLC
    │
    ├─ Buy RAW land → Develop infrastructure → Build HOMES → Sell HOMES
    │  (Two phases: horizontal development + vertical construction)
    │  → Use: TEMPLATE_SPE_Community_Development.csv
    │     Example: Warpath Community, LLC
    │
    ├─ Buy INDIVIDUAL finished lots → Build homes → Sell
    │  (Opportunistic 1-5 lot purchases, quick turn)
    │  → Use: TEMPLATE_SPE_Scattered_Lot.csv
    │     Example: Scattered Infill 2025, LLC
    │
    └─ Buy BULK finished lots from developer → Build homes → Sell
       (Purchase 5-50 lots upfront, build over 12-24 months)
       → Use: TEMPLATE_SPE_Lot_Purchase.csv
          Example: Keowee Estates Takedown, LLC

================================================================================
🎯 STEP 2: OPEN TEMPLATE IN EXCEL/GOOGLE SHEETS
-----------------------------------------------

METHOD A: EXCEL
1. Download the appropriate TEMPLATE_XXX.csv file
2. Right-click → Open With → Microsoft Excel
3. OR open Excel → File → Open → Select CSV

METHOD B: GOOGLE SHEETS
1. Go to sheets.google.com
2. File → Import
3. Upload the CSV file
4. Import settings:
   - Import location: Replace current sheet
   - Separator type: Comma
   - Convert text to numbers: No (important!)

RESULT: You should see columns:

- B: Account Name
- C: Parent Account
- D: Account Type
- E: Is Group
- F: Root Type
- G: Required
- H: Description

================================================================================
🎯 STEP 3: CUSTOMIZE THE TEMPLATE
---------------------------------

You'll use FIND & REPLACE to customize these variables:

VARIABLE LIST (What to replace):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ VARIABLE              REPLACE WITH           EXAMPLE             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ {{ABBR}}              Entity abbreviation    PELH                │
│ {{MEMBER_1_NAME}}     First partner name     Ron Maugeri         │
│ {{MEMBER_2_NAME}}     Second partner name    Bryan De Bruin      │
│ {{BUILDER_NAME}}      Builder if different   RCH (or keep RCH)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

DETAILED FIND/REPLACE INSTRUCTIONS:

✅ STEP 3A: Entity Abbreviation (ALL TEMPLATES)
----------------------------------------------
Find:    {{ABBR}}
Replace: Your entity abbreviation (3-5 letters)

Examples:
- 1943 Pelham, LLC → PELH
- Warpath Community, LLC → WRPTH
- Red Cedar Homes, LLC → RCH
- Keowee Estates, LLC → KEES

In Excel: Ctrl+H (Windows) or Cmd+H (Mac)
In Google Sheets: Edit → Find and Replace

Result: "Cash - Operating Account - {{ABBR}}" 
    → "Cash - Operating Account - PELH"

✅ STEP 3B: Member Names (SPE TEMPLATES ONLY - Skip for Operating Company)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Find:    {{MEMBER_1_NAME}}
Replace: First partner's actual name

Example: Ron Maugeri

Find:    {{MEMBER_2_NAME}}
Replace: Second partner's actual name

Example: Bryan De Bruin

Result: "Member Capital - {{MEMBER_1_NAME}} - Contributed"
    → "Member Capital - Ron Maugeri - Contributed"

⚠️ IF YOU HAVE 3+ MEMBERS: See Section "Adding Additional Members" below

✅ STEP 3C: Builder Name (SPE TEMPLATES ONLY - Skip for Operating Company)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only necessary if you're using a builder OTHER than RCH

Find:    {{BUILDER_NAME}}
Replace: Your builder name (or keep "RCH")

Examples:
- Red Cedar Homes → RCH (default, no change needed)
- ABC Builders → ABC

Note: Only appears in:
- TEMPLATE_SPE_Community_Development.csv
- TEMPLATE_SPE_Scattered_Lot.csv
- TEMPLATE_SPE_Lot_Purchase.csv

Result: "Accounts Payable - {{BUILDER_NAME}} (Builder)"
    → "Accounts Payable - RCH (Builder)"

✅ STEP 3D: Verify All Variables Replaced
-----------------------------------------
Search for "{{" - you should find ZERO results
If you find any, you missed a variable - go back and replace it

================================================================================
🎯 STEP 4: OPTIONAL CUSTOMIZATIONS
----------------------------------

ADD CUSTOM ACCOUNTS (Optional):
-------------------------------
You can add more accounts following the numbering system.

Example: Want to add another cash account?
1. Find row: 1100-03, Cash - Escrow Account
2. Insert new row after it
3. Add: 1100-04, Cash - Special Account - PELH, 1100, Bank, 0, Asset, No, Your description

Rules:
- Parent account must exist (1100 in this example)
- Use next sequential number (1100-04)
- Keep same structure as other rows

REMOVE UNNECESSARY ACCOUNTS (Optional):
---------------------------------------
You can delete rows for accounts you won't use.

⚠️ WARNING: DO NOT delete accounts marked "Yes" in Required column!

Example: Don't need model home accounting?
- Delete rows containing "Model Home"

Safe to remove:
- Accounts with Required = "No"
- Detail accounts (Is Group = 0)
- Optional categories

NOT safe to remove:
- Accounts with Required = "Yes"
- Main category accounts (1000, 2000, 3000, etc.)
- Group accounts with children

RENAME ACCOUNTS (Optional):
---------------------------
You can change account names in Column B.

Example: 
From: "Cash - Operating Account - PELH"
To:   "Cash - Main Checking Account - PELH"

⚠️ DON'T change Column A (Account Number)!

ADDING 3RD, 4TH, 5TH MEMBERS (SPEs only):
-----------------------------------------
Default template has 2 members. To add more:

1. Find the member equity section (rows with 3100-XX and 3200-XX)
2. Current structure:
   3100-01, Member Capital - Member 1 - Contributed
   3100-02, Member Capital - Member 1 - Allocated Profit/Loss
   3100-03, Member Capital - Member 2 - Contributed
   3100-04, Member Capital - Member 2 - Allocated Profit/Loss
   3200-01, Distributions - Member 1
   3200-02, Distributions - Member 2

3. Add new rows for Member 3:
   3100-05, Member Capital - {{MEMBER_3_NAME}} - Contributed, 3100,,0,Equity,No,
   3100-06, Member Capital - {{MEMBER_3_NAME}} - Allocated Profit/Loss, 3100,,0,Equity,No,
   3200-03, Distributions - {{MEMBER_3_NAME}}, 3200,,0,Equity,No,

4. Then do find/replace for {{MEMBER_3_NAME}}

5. Repeat for 4th, 5th members (3100-07, 3100-08, 3200-04, etc.)

================================================================================
🎯 STEP 5: SAVE YOUR CUSTOMIZED FILE
------------------------------------

File Naming Convention:
Format: COA_[EntityName]_[Abbreviation]_Import.csv

Examples:
- COA_1943Pelham_PELH_Import.csv
- COA_RedCedarHomes_RCH_Import.csv
- COA_Warpath_WRPTH_Import.csv

In Excel:
1. File → Save As
2. File type: CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv)
3. Save

In Google Sheets:
1. File → Download → Comma-separated values (.csv)

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Save as CSV, not Excel (.xlsx)!

================================================================================
🎯 STEP 6: VALIDATE BEFORE IMPORTING
------------------------------------

Run through this checklist:

STRUCTURAL CHECKS:
□ All {{VARIABLES}} replaced (search for "{{" = zero results)
□ Entity abbreviation looks good
□ Member names are correct (not placeholder text)
□ No blank rows
□ No extra columns
□ Saved as .csv file

REQUIRED ACCOUNTS:
□ 1100-01 (Cash account) exists
□ 1200-01 (Accounts Receivable) exists
□ 2100-01 (Accounts Payable) exists
□ 3XXX equity accounts exist
□ At least one 4XXX revenue account
□ At least one 5XXX COGS account

MEMBER ACCOUNTS (SPEs only):
□ Each member has capital contributed account (3100-01, 3100-03)
□ Each member has allocated P/L account (3100-02, 3100-04)
□ Each member has distribution account (3200-01, 3200-02)
□ Member count matches (2, 3, 4, or 5 members)

FILE FORMAT:
□ File is CSV format (.csv extension)
□ Opened in Excel/Sheets without errors
□ Proper column structure (8 columns)

================================================================================

----------------------------------

🔧 KOVA IMPORT:
-----------------
1. Log into KOVA
2. Navigate to: Setup → Chart of Accounts → Import
3. Click: Import Chart of Accounts
4. Upload your CSV file
5. Map columns (usually auto-detects):
   - Account Number → Account Code
   - Account Name → Account Name
   - Parent Account → Parent Account Code
   - Account Type → Account Type
   - Is Group → Is Header Account (1=Yes, 0=No)
   - Root Type → Account Class
6. Preview import
7. Click: Complete Import

🔧 QUICKBOOKS ONLINE:
--------------------
1. Gear icon → Import Data
2. Chart of Accounts
3. Browse → Select your CSV
4. Map columns
5. Import
6. Review accounts

🔧 CUSTOM SYSTEM:
----------------
Your developer will need:
- CSV parsing
- Parent-child relationship validation
- Account type mapping
- Hierarchy creation (parents before children)

================================================================================
🎯 TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES
--------------------------------

❌ ERROR: "Parent account not found"
✅ FIX: Accounts must be imported in order (parents before children)
     The CSV is already in correct order, but some systems require
     you to import group accounts first, then detail accounts.

❌ ERROR: "Duplicate account number"
✅ FIX: Check for duplicate rows in your CSV
     Each account number must be unique

❌ ERROR: "Invalid account type"
✅ FIX: Your system may use different account type names
     Map to system-specific types:
     - Bank → Cash, Checking, etc.
     - Receivable → Accounts Receivable
     - Payable → Accounts Payable
     - Fixed Asset → Property, Plant, Equipment
     - Expense → Expense, Cost of Goods Sold
     - Income → Revenue, Income

❌ ERROR: "Account name too long"
✅ FIX: Some systems limit account name length
     Shorten names in Column B before importing
     Keep account numbers the same

❌ ERROR: "{{VARIABLE}} found in account name"
✅ FIX: You forgot to do find/replace
     Go back to Step 3, complete all find/replace

❌ ERROR: "Invalid characters"
✅ FIX: Some systems don't allow certain characters
     Common issues: é, ñ, special symbols
     Replace with standard letters

❌ ERROR: "Circular reference"
✅ FIX: Account cannot be its own parent
     Check Parent Account column (Column C)

================================================================================
📋 QUICK REFERENCE: VARIABLE REPLACEMENT CHECKLIST
--------------------------------------------------

FOR ALL TEMPLATES:
□ Replace {{ABBR}} with entity abbreviation (e.g., PELH, RCH, WRPTH)
□ Verify all {{ABBR}} replaced (search should return zero results)

FOR SPE TEMPLATES ONLY:
□ Replace {{MEMBER_1_NAME}} with first partner name
□ Replace {{MEMBER_2_NAME}} with second partner name
□ Replace {{BUILDER_NAME}} if using different builder (or keep RCH)
□ Add additional members if needed (Member 3, 4, 5)
□ Verify all {{MEMBER_X_NAME}} replaced

FOR OPERATING COMPANY ONLY:
□ Replace {{ABBR}} with company abbreviation
□ No member name replacement needed (uses different equity structure)

FINAL CHECK FOR ALL:
□ Search for "{{" → Should find ZERO results
□ Save as CSV file
□ Ready to import!

❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
----------------------------

Q: Can I use the same template for multiple projects?
A: YES! That's the whole point. Use TEMPLATE_SPE_Lot_Development.csv
   for every lot development project. Just customize the {{ABBR}} and
   member names differently for each.

Q: What if I have 3 partners instead of 2?
A: Add additional member accounts (see "Adding 3rd, 4th, 5th Members" above)

Q: Can I add accounts later after importing?
A: YES! You can add accounts in the system or re-import an updated CSV

Q: Should I use entity suffix ({{ABBR}}) or not?
A: RECOMMENDED: Use it. Makes consolidated reporting much easier.
   You can clearly see which entity each account belongs to.

Q: What if my builder isn't RCH?
A: Do find/replace: {{BUILDER_NAME}} → Your builder abbreviation

Q: Can I remove accounts I don't need?
A: YES, but ONLY accounts marked Required = "No"
   DO NOT remove accounts marked Required = "Yes"

Q: Do I need all 8 columns in the CSV?
A: No - the last 2 columns (Required, Description) are for reference.
   Most systems only need the first 6 columns.

Q: Can I change account numbers?
A: NOT RECOMMENDED. The numbering is industry standard.
   You can rename accounts, but keep numbers consistent.

Q: What if import fails?
A: Check error message, refer to "Troubleshooting" section above
   Most issues: parent accounts missing, duplicates, or formatting

Q: How do I know which template to use?
A: Refer to "STEP 1: SELECT THE RIGHT TEMPLATE" decision tree above
